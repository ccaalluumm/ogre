# Ogre 👹
A simple downloader agent written in C#. The goal of this project is to have a single binary that, when run on a Windows 10 machine, will download and install a number programs useful for development.
Why is it called Ogre? Well, because it's ugly, stupid! Just like Windows 10! 

# Why? 🕵🏻‍♂️
Let's be honest, Windows 10 is a terrible operating system, but let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater here! Some of us masochists still voluntarily choose Windows 10 as our main operating system, sometimes even for dev work; some of us involuntarily, kicking and screaming! Either way, we're still going to be stuck with Windows 10 for the foreseeable future, so why not make it smooooth sailin'?

Part of smoothing out the wrinkles in Windows is to often revert to a fresh install. This means we have to reinstall a huge number of programs that are essential for day to day work, such as Firefox or Chrome, VS Code, Git, and many more. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to run a single binary and have all those programs installed for you, without having to visit every one of their websites, navigate to the download link, and then go through the install process?

# How? 👨🏼‍💻
Don't ask me questions like that! I'm a hacker, bro! I just knock things together and it works! But in all seriousness, this project is not intended to be anything professional. The goal of the project (not the software itself) is the following:

1. To learn a bit of C#
2. To learn some of the The .NET API
3. To build a tool that helps at least one person, even if that sole person is myself

# Resources 📚
Looks like I might need to head to the bookstore! This section will eventually contain relevant resources for achieving the outcome of this project.
